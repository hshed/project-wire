project-wire
============

My first programming project. Project wire was built on the idea of anonymous social networking before it was cool ;)

However, it never saw the light of the day and after a month, it was converted to Collegewires, a programming tutorials blog.

Warning: Viewer's discretion is advised. A lot of bad code found.
